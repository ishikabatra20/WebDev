<!-- 
The <input> tag is a commonly used HTML tag that is used to create an input field or form control on a webpage. 
It allows users to input data, such as text, numbers, or other types of data, into a web form. 
The <input> tag has several attributes that can be used to customize its behavior and appearance. 
Here are some examples of how the <input> tag can be used:

1. disabled: This attribute is used to disable the input field, preventing any user input. When an input field is disabled, 
its value cannot be changed by the user.

2. readonly: This attribute is used to make the input field read-only, allowing the user to view the value but not modify it. 
Unlike disabled, a read-only input field can still be submitted with the form data.

3. autocomplete: This attribute is used to specify whether the input field should have autocomplete functionality enabled or disabled. 
It takes a boolean value, such as "on" or "off", to control whether the browser should remember and suggest previously 
entered values for the input field.

4. capture: This attribute is used with the input element of type "file" and is used to specify how the file should be captured. 
It can take values like "user" to allow the user to choose a file from their device, "environment" to capture a media file using the 
device's camera or microphone, or "none" to disable file capture.

5. min and max: These attributes are used to set the minimum and maximum allowed values for numeric input fields, such as number, 
range, and date. For example, min="0" and max="100" would limit the input field to accept values between 0 and 100.

6. maxlength and minlength: These attributes are used to specify the maximum and minimum length of text input fields, respectively. 
They can be used with text, search, url, tel, email, password, and textarea input types.

7. placeholder: This attribute is used to provide a hint or example text that is displayed in the input field until the user enters a value. It is typically used to provide instructions or suggestions for the expected input.

8. value: This attribute is used to set the initial value of the input field. It can be used with various input types to specify the 
default value that will be displayed when the form loads.
