<!-- 
The <form> tag is used to create a container for collecting and submitting data from user input on a web page. 
It is used to define a section of a web page that contains input fields, buttons, and other form elements, 
which allow users to enter and submit data to a web server.

The <form> element has several attributes that can be used to specify how the form should behave, 
such as action, method, enctype, and target. Here's a brief overview of these attributes:

action: This attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be submitted when the form is submitted. 
It can be a relative or absolute URL, or a JavaScript function to handle form submission.

method: This attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used for submitting the form data. 
It can be either "GET" or "POST". "GET" method appends the form data to the URL as query parameters, 
while "POST" method sends the form data in the request body.

enctype: This attribute specifies the encoding type for the form data when it is submitted. 
It is used with the method attribute set to "POST". Common values include "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" for URL-encoded form data 
and "multipart/form-data" for binary or large form data.

target: This attribute specifies where the form response should be displayed after form submission. 
It can take values like "_self" (default), "_blank", "_parent", or "_top", or a custom target name.

<!-- 
1. <input> elements: These are used to collect user input. There are three <input> elements in this form:

One with type="text" and name="email": This is a text input field where users can enter their email address.
One with type="password" and name="pwd": This is a password input field where users can enter their password.
One with type="submit" and value="login": This is a submit button that users can click to submit the form data.
-->

        <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Enter email" >
        <input type="password" name="pwd" placeholder="Enter password" >
        <input type="submit" value="login" >
<!-- 
2. <label>: 

The <label> tag is used to associate a label with an input field in a form. 
It is typically used to provide a text description for an input field, such as a text input, checkbox, or radio button. 
The for attribute of the <label> tag should match the id attribute of the associated input field, so that clicking on the label 
will focus or activate the associated input field.
 -->
        <label>Age</label>
<!-- 
3. <select> element: 
This is a dropdown list where users can select an option. It has the name attribute set to "userage" and
the size attribute set to "1", which means it will display one option at a time.  
<option>: The <option> tag is used to define the individual options within the <select> tag. 
 -->
        <select name="userAge" id="age" size="1">
            <option value="1">1</option>
            <option value="2" selected>2</option>
            <option value="3">3</option>
        </select>
        <!-- Since user can himself inc the size of this textarea we can use maxheight and maxwidth to avoid this -->
        <p>
<!-- 
4. <textarea> element: 
This is a multi-line text input field where users can enter a longer message. 
It has the name attribute set to "message" and the rows and cols attributes set to control the size of the textarea. 
-->
            <textarea name="message" rows="10" cols="30" style="max-width: 100px; max-height: 100px;">Description </textarea>
       
<!-- 
5. <button> element: 
This is a button that users can click. It has the type attribute set to "button" and an onclick attribute that 
specifies a JavaScript function to be executed when the button is clicked. In this case, it displays an alert with the message "hey there".
 -->
        <button type="button" onclick="alert('hey there')">click me</button>
<!-- 
6. <fieldset> element: 
This is used to group related form elements together. It has a <legend> element inside that specifies a caption for the fieldset, 
which in this case is "Login". Inside the fieldset, there are two <input> elements:

One with type="text" and name="email": This is a text input field where users can enter their email address. 
It also has a list attribute that references a <datalist> element with the id "myname", which provides suggestions for the input field.
One with type="password" and name="pwd": This is a password input field where users can enter their password.
There is also an <input> element with type="submit", which is a submit button that users can click to submit the form data. 
It has additional attributes formaction="/someotherpath", and formenctype="multipart/form-data". 
These attributes override the form-level action, method, and enctype attributes for this specific submit button. 
When this submit button is clicked, the form data will be submitted to the URL specified in the formaction attribute, 
using the encoding type specified in the formenctype attribute, and the HTTP method specified in the formmethod attribute.
 -->
        <fieldset >
            <legend>Login Form</legend>
            <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Enter email" list="myname" >
<!-- 
7. <datalist>: The <datalist> tag is used to provide a pre-defined list of options for an input field in a form. 
The <datalist> tag is used in conjunction with an <input> field of type "text" or "search", and 
the list of options is defined using <option> tags within the <datalist> tag. The user can select an option from the list or 
enter a custom value.
 -->
            <datalist id="myname">
                <option value="name 1">
                    <option value="name 2">
                    <option value="name 3">
            </datalist>
            <input type="password" name="pwd" placeholder="Enter password" >
            <input type="submit" value="login" formaction="someotherpath"
            formenctype="multipart/form-data" formmethod="get" formtarget="_self"
            >
        </fieldset>
        
<!-- Here, since the button is now out of the form then will it work or not. so, in order to make it form use this id form="myform" -->
    </p>
    </form>
    <input type="submit" value="login" form="myform" formaction="someotherpath">
    
</body>
