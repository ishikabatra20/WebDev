<!-- A pixel does not have a fixed physical size.

On paper (printing), 1 pixel is often treated as 1/72 or 1/96 of an inch by convention, but on screens itâ€™s relative to resolution and display size. -->

    But 50% in pxvalue means it will take 50% of the container's width.

    .container {
      font-size: 50px;
    }
    .pxvalue {
      
    }
    
    When there is no font-size mentioned in pxvalue class then it was automatically getting css of container class. In inspect the values 
    were like these-
    .container {
    font-size: 50px;
    }

    .pxvalue{
    }

    Case 2: 
    .container {
      font-size: 50px;
    }
    .pxvalue {
      font-size: 20px;
    }

    now, it's taking css of pxvalue only and in inspect it was visualise as a strikethrough on container class font-size and pxvalue
    font-size is considerable in this case.

    }

    /* 
    2. em-

    The em value is a unit of measurement that is relative to the font size of the parent element. For example, 
    if the font size of a parent element is 10 pixels, then 3em would be equal to 30 pixels. 
    if the font size of a parent element is 10 pixels, then 1.5em would be equal to 15 pixels.

          So, vw is used to take the width of whole window.
      */

    /* 
    5. vw:-

    vw: The vw value is a unit of measurement that represents a percentage of the viewport width. For example, 
    50vw would be 50% of the viewport width
    */

    /* 
    3. rem-


    The rem value is similar to the em value, but it is relative to the root element (i.e., the html element). 
    
    So, here if i don't mention the html tag i.e., root element font size even if 

    .remValue{
        font-size: 2rem;
    }
    this is mention 

    it won't change it's size. Even if i change container's font-size value that won't affect this. So , do mention 
    html and remValue's values then only it will work.
    TO make rem work we need to mntn html
    
    */

    /* 

    6. ch:-
    ch: The ch value is a unit of measurement that represents the width of the "0" character in the font used for the element.

<!-- 
/* 
**Common Units for font-size:**

- px (Pixels): An absolute, fixed-size unit. font-size: 16px; means the text will be exactly 16 pixels tall. Good for consistency, but less flexible for users who want to change their browser's default font size.
- em: A relative unit. 1em is equal to the font size of the **parent element**. If a parent <div> has a font-size of 16px, then font-size: 2em; on a child <p> will make it 32px (16 * 2).
- rem (Root Em): **The modern standard.** This is the most flexible and recommended unit. 1rem is equal to the font size of the **root <html> element**. This allows you to set a base font size on the <html> tag, and then all your other font sizes can be relative to that one single value, making it incredibly easy to scale your entire site's typography.
